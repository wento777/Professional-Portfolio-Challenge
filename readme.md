# Professional-Portfolio-Challenge




 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 2 Challenge, Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

-  This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

- A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.


- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you'll use during your job search. It's a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

- You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:
   The URL of the functional, deployed application.

    The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

## Usage

  - This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the last week of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.


  


## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Summary

An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.
